Ludum Dare 31
=============

This is just my base code from https://github.com/Mirroar/LDLib with some cleaning up for now. Once the compo starts, a game will be developed in less than 48 hours within this repository.

Ideas
-----

- Dungeon, complete on one screen
- exit the game by leaving through the side of the window
- (maybe) Includes options via switches or pushable blocks
- Increasing difficulty when finished a dungeon
- same layout, but random elements (traps may be active or not, monsters spawn or not)
- Tiles will be 16px x 8px, looking from above at an angle
